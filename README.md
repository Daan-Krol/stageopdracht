# Daily Balance / Payuung-Pribadi (prototype)
A very early-stage prototype for the Payuung Pribadi platform, developed by myself during my internship at Fast8 in Jakarta, Indonesia.
During my internship, I worked extensively with the Payuung Pribadi platform. As part of exploring and prototyping ideas for the platform, I created this small standalone prototype focused on a daily wellness and the "balance system", including daily activities, progress tracking, streaks, history, and a simple gamified tree system.

This prototype was designed and developed entirely by me as an early demonstration of how these concepts could work.
